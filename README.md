# Battleship
The classic paper and pencil game of Battleship remade for modern browsers with ReactJS and TDD.
This project was made for an Odin Project [curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript/lessons/battleship).
The main objective of this project to to practice test drive development (TDD) principles with Jest.
I've also used this opportunity to work with ReactJS using functional components with React hooks.
